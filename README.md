# The Octo Programming Language
Octo is a programming language I'm writing for educational purposes.

```
import std;

func main() -> void
{
	std::println("Hello, Octo!");
}
```

Planned features:
- Generics
- Compile-time function execution
- Closures
- Interop with C
- Rust-like tagged unions
- If-expressions and switch-expressions

P.S. Octo is in the early stages of development. The parser isn't even done yet.
